Miracle
^^^^^^^

*Oh, come on! The guy was dead for about eight years! His brain had
completely decayed! It was quite obviously a miracle. A 100%
supernatural God-proving miracle. Admit it.* OK. OK. Let's be completely
open and honest about all this, then. I wasn't going to explain it, but
you've got me in a corner here. This is a story that combines a few
slightly impossible things, and then extrapolates a plot. It mixes in
some people who really did exist, like Douglas Adams, with some people
who didn't, like Samuel. I did that because I want to show you
something; I'm using characters and narrative to carry a message, and
featuring a few real people, places and events adds credibility and
makes it easier to remember. I'm kind of spoiling the fun a little, but
I'm trying to show how Samuel learns how we know things, and what that
means for his life. Maybe it means something for your life too.

Can you think of another book that uses the same narrative devices? What
if some of the things you thought were literal, aren't? Would the
messages in that other book be different?
