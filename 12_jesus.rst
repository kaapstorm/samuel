Jesus
-----

Samuel thought about what Douglas had said. He thought about the
questions that the German priest had asked. Today, this is how Samuel
explains it to his students.

    Jesus is not just a way of reading Scripture. He is also a
    reflection of ourselves.

    Seeing the Son of Man coming with his kingdom is not an event. His
    kingdom is not a place. His kingdom is a way of living. Jesus is a
    way of interpreting the Torah; the most compassionate way. And so
    seeing the Son of Man coming with his kingdom means living, every
    day and all the time, the most compassionate interpretation of the
    Torah.

    This can be done, indeed must be done, for all Scripture, and even
    non-religious texts. The first ten amendments of the United States
    Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights both
    demand compassionate interpretation, and the reasons they were
    written should be carved into the hearts of all of us.

    This is not Christianity, or Judaism, or Islam. It is not religion.
    It is just compassion. Compassion that becomes the thread from which
    the fabric of your life is woven. Compassion that you live in, and
    that lives through you.

    This is what it means to live in the kingdom of God. And just like
    the way Jesus appeared to his disciples after his death, when it
    turned out that he was there all along and we just hadn't noticed
    him, but when we did it changed everything. So the kingdom of God
    has always been here. It took me so long to notice it. But now that
    I have, it changes everything.
