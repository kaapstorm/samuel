Islam
-----

Samuel and Isaac were pleasantly surprised by Islam. Muslims had a
certain respect for Christianity, and especially Jewish Christianity,
that contradicted the stories they had heard in the Empire. Muslims
followed many of the southern Christian customs, like women's head
coverings, and facing Jerusalem when they prayed, although they faced
Mecca instead.

Samuel and Isaac moved south to Arabia, and then gradually west, across
north Africa, and then over to Jabal ṬTāriq and Al-Andalus, what is
today the south of Spain.

Samuel and Isaac lived all over Al-Andalus over the centuries. Many
times Isaac worked as a cartographer. Samuel and Isaac both learned to
read, for the first time in their lives, not Aramaic, which they still
spoke to each other in private, not Hebrew nor Greek, but Arabic, which
was now the language they spoke every day.

Neither Samuel nor Isaac had been intellectually inclined, but in the
caliphates of al-Andalus there was a spirit of study and reason that
followed from the work of Ibn Sina [#]_ and Ibn Rushd [#]_
after those philosophers' ideas had been deprecated in the east.
