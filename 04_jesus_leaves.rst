Jesus leaves
------------

Jesus left the room, and everyone followed him. He walked almost as far
as Bethany. Then he raised his hands and blessed them all. As he was
blessing them, he was lifted off the ground.

Samuel should have been used to miracles by now, but he gasped. Everyone
did. They stared, open mouthed. Jesus rose up, into the sky, his hands
still raised. He went steadily up and up, and got smaller and smaller.

You and I have seen helium baloons floating up, and have seen the way
they get caught in draughts. Jesus was not moved about. His clothing was
blown a little, but we would probably be reminded of movies involving
tractor beams. Of course, first century Jews had never seen helium
baloons or sci fi movies. But they thought God lived above the
firmament, so it made perfect sense to them.

There was a while where some people said they could still see Jesus, and
tried to point him out to those who couldn't any more. Samuel's eyes
were only a couple of weeks old, and he was one of the last to see Jesus
until he was tinier than a speck, and then nobody could see him any
more.

Then his followers started excitedly shouting to one another, "Did you
see that?! Did you see that?!" They hurried back to Jerusalem, and
Samuel went back to his family and told everyone. From then on they hung
out with Jesus' followers, worshipped in the Temple with them, and met
up often.
